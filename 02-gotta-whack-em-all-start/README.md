## Gotta whack-em-all Lab/Homework

The task in this lab is to create a working whack-a-mole game, where the players have a limited amount of time (to your choosing, recommended: 10 seconds) to click on as many Pickachus as they can.

Here are all the steps you will have to take care of at some point to make this game work. You can follow the chronological order, but you don't have to follow it exactly. The ultimate goal is for you to have a whack-a-mole style kind of game that works!

1.) Create a 10x10 grid using JavaScript. This code will be very similar to the code you've seen during the Grid Movement codealong. However please don't copy & paste, instead try to write the code yourself with the information you received during the codealong.\
2.) Write code that makes a Pikachu appear every one second on the grid. Make it a function.\
3.) Write code that makes a Pikachu disappear. Make it a function.\
4.) Write a function that awards the player points, when they click on a Pikachu. Make the points appear at the top right in "Current Score".\
5.) To not have multiple Pikachus on the grid at the same time, you will also have to handle the removal of the previous Pikachu whenever the previous pikachu is clicked or when one second has passed. Use the functions from step 2 and 3 to achieve that.\
6.) Write some logic to let the user start the game, when the "Start whacking!" button is clicked.\
7.) Write some logic that will display the current players score at the top right.\
8.) Write some logic to end the game. You can use your own condition based on time or score or number of Pikachus that have appeared.
For example, you could say if 10 Pikachus have appeared you want to stop the game.
