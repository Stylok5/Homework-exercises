# React Tube Line Challenge

We’d like you to build an App to monitor the current status of the London Underground.

Using the TfL API (see client.http for the endpoint to use), build a mobile-oriented web app that:
• Lists the London Underground lines sorted alphabetically \
• Shows the current status of each line \
• Updates the status every 5 minutes

Feel free to style the app as you wish, but see "example.png" below for a rough
idea on what to produce.

You can find all the data you need under this public endpoint:
`https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status`.

## Tips

- Remember to test endpoints with HTTPClient before attempting to use them in your
  code.
- The axios fetching library has already been installed for you.
