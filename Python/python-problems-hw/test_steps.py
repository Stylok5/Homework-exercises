# ssssE.Fss - s' are skipped, E is error, F is fail, . is passed
# pass can be removed from the functions, this is a python keyword to essentially skip or execute nothing
# return is the same in python
# need to remove @unittest.skip from defs in test.py file to get tests to run for each function

# Saturday is going to be functions and classes in the morning
