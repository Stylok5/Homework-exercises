        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          Coppa Club is a place for eating, drinking, meeting and unwinding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built around a central, brass bar that's open on all-sides, Coppa Club
          has a raised lounge for working and winding down, a 250-cover
          restaurant with a marble herringbone floor, and a café with booths and
          a fireplace. Outside, there's a large, south-facing terrace that
          catches the sun all day. All our seating is designed to make the most
          of our view over the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our menu focuses on thoughtful, unfussy, European food from small
          plates and snacks to grilled mains, sourdough pizzas and healthy
          salads. There's a wide selection of breakfast and brunch dishes and
          the bar serves carefully-chosen wines, beers and classic cocktails as
          well as new creations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are open from early morning until late at night, seven days a week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drop in for breakfast and stay for dinner. No-one outstays their
          welcome.

          We've installed eight giant igloos on our terrace<br />
          to make the most of our view over the river. <br />
          The igloos are available to book throughout the day<br />
          from breakfast through to dinner for up to a<br />
          maximum of 8 people, all bookings under 6 <br />
          people will be sharing with other guests.<br />
          Bookings can be made online only and are<br />
          available until 31st March. We still leave some <br />
          igloos for walk-ins in case your requested day<br />
          and time is already taken, so feel free to drop in <br />
          and have a drink at the bar as you wait.
